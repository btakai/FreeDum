Update Logs will be posted here

Oct 4, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Linked the main buttons in the Month and List Activities
		Launching Month from List or List from Month closes the
		previous Activity. Therefore, pressing the back button closes
		the application.
		Launching NewEvent from List or Month keeps the previous
		Activity open. Therefore, pressing the back button is the same
		as canceling creating a new event.
	Added a logout button in the Action-bar of Month and List Activities
		Sends user to login page

Oct 1, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Created activities for the following:
		List
		Login
		Month
		New Event
		Sign Up
	If there were any layouts already created for the aforementioned
		activities in FreeDum/layout, they were moved into 
		FreeDum/res/layout and renamed to reflect the created activity.
	Used basic template from https://github.com/earphone/AndroidTest/App/
		blob/master/res/layout/login.xml for layout of login:
		FreeDum/res/layout/activity_login.xml
	Imported Parse-1.3.5 into FreeDum/libs
	Set up initializtion of Parse in LoginActivity
	Set LogingActivity as launcher activity
	Implemented Parse login and sign up in LoginActivity and SignUpActivity
		but currently signup does not check for empty fields and lets
		them through.
